# TODO

- [ ] css for making the heading of a section stay at the top of the section when you're scrolling
- [ ] table on contents in Tags page
- [ ] links to local posts using `[[NAME]]` syntax
- [ ] BUG: for _only_ deepest node in table of contents tree, there's no paragraph wrapped around the link??
