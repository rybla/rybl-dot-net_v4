# TODO

- [ ] for posts, instead of post title as the resource title that goes in the Top, put a hash of the content, since that looks more cool

- [ ] PostPreview (e.g. for use in Index and Tags pages)
- [ ] Index page
- [ ] Tags page
- [ ] About apge
- [ ] css for making the heading of a section stay at the top of the section when you're scrolling
- [ ] table on contents in Tags page
- [ ] Footer
- [ ] links to local posts using `[[NAME]]` syntax
- [ ] BUG: for _only_ deepest node in table of contents tree, there's no paragraph wrapped around the link??

- [x] Header
