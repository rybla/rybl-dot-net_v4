# TODO

- [ ] fix when sometimes downloads a bad file for the icon
- [ ] About page
- [ ] css for making the heading of a section stay at the top of the section when you're scrolling
- [ ] for posts, instead of post title as the resource title that goes in the Top, put a hash of the content, since that looks more cool
- [ ] Footer
- [ ] links to local posts using `[[NAME]]` syntax
- [ ] BUG: for _only_ deepest node in table of contents tree, there's no paragraph wrapped around the link??

- [x] make sure that math and other plugins are being activated
- [x] Tags page
  - [x] table on contents
- [x] PostPreview (e.g. for use in Index and Tags pages)
- [x] Index page
- [x] Header
