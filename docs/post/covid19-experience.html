<p>I recently contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus, with my symptoms starting on June 15
and my first positive tests (1 PCR and 1 rapid antigen) on June 17. I had
attended a college reunion on the weekend June 11-12, which was a large
gathering of hundreds of people. The event was almost entirely outside, but
people were often very close together. The event lines up when I developed
symptoms, and my family who attended the event with me also developed symptoms
at the same time as me, even though we parted on June 13, so I heavily suspect
that this event is where I contracted the virus.</p>
<p>During June 13-15, I did not experience any noticable symptoms.</p>
<p>On the night of June 15, I began to have a cough and a mild fever. I went to
sleep feeling very hot and congested, so I needed to blow my nose constantly and
prop myself up to sleep so that my nose did not clog completely.</p>
<p>On the morning of June 16, I woke up feeling fine -- the fever had passed and I
only had very mild congestion. So, I thought that whatever it was must have
passed and I went to work (I commute to work at an office) as usual. When I got
home from work that day, I started to have more severe symptoms. I developed a
sore throat, a mild headache, and the congestion was back. This was the worst I
felt during my sickness. I didn't feel very bad -- I've been sick with the
seasonal flu much worse many times before -- but I could tell that it was not
over with like I had thought that morning. I decided I would work form home the
next day and also go to a testing center to get a PCR test. All the symptoms I
had were consistent with COVID-19, so I thought it was likely. I slept fine that
night, though with mild congestion.</p>
<p>On the morning of June 17, I felt the same as the night before except my
headache was gone. I went to the testing center to take a PCR test. I would get
the results of this test in about 24 hours. When I got back to my house, I
notified my landlord (who is an older man) that I was concerned I may have
COVID-19, and he offered me a rapid antigen test kit. I tested positive on this
test, and so started my quarantine. I asked my family if they had any symptoms,
and they mentioned that my dad had developed a sore throat as well. They all
then took rapid antgen tests and he tested positive. I felt very mild symptoms
for the rest of the day, and slept fine.</p>
<p>On June 18 my symptoms were slightly less severe. My mild congestion and sore
throat persisted.</p>
<p>On June 19 my symptoms were almost gone. My congestion was gone, and my sore
throat manifested as about two short coughing sessions during the day.</p>
<p>One June 20 my symptoms were entirely gone. I still had a little big of phlegm
in my throat that I spit up about two times during the day, but I didn't need to
cough. According to the CDC reccomendations, this was to be my last day of
quarantine if I continued to lack symptoms. I decided to work from home one more
time the next day just to be sure, but I figured I was safe to go out and buy
groceries, etc. as normal as long as I wore a mask. My plan was to return to the
office on June 22.</p>
<p>On June 22, I successfully returned to my normal office-going work schedule. I
wore a surgical mask while in the office and public areas until June 26 (which
is the end of the 10-day period that the CDC reccomended to continue wearing a
mask after developing symptoms).</p>
<p>As on July 9, I have not, at far as I can tell, experienced any <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html" class="LinkWithIcon"><img src="/asset/icon/www.cdc.gov" class="icon"><span class="label">"long COVID"</span></a>
